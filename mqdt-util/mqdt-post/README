1: calculate mqdt equation with  DIS.v0  (for bound)/ Au4.v0 (for continuum) at server.
   These two programs' input out are modified to be very similar to each other, so that I
   can modify them for different energy region calculations. And I will read mqdt.in (bound) 
   or acmqdt(continuum) as input for my later postprocess control keys.
2: transfer the result :
        tau.out
        Anorm.out
        Ara.out
        Dn.out 
        mqdt.in (acmqdt.in for continuum) 
        [miuang.out 
         dalfa.in 
              are also need (I know it's not mandatory, 
              I will modify this later), so I can construct 
              dfde internally in my postprocess code.]

   to your linux  computer. You can do it faster by zipping the files then scp to your computer:
       in the server    : 
          zip result.zip tau.out Anorm.out Ara.out Dn.out mqdt.in miuang.out dalfa.in
       on your computer : 
          scp -P 2500 guchun@202.120.60.30:YOUR_MQDT_RESULT_DIR/result.zip YOUR_POST_PROCESS_DIR/.
       then unzip       :
          unzip result.zip

3 run post process program (including constructing dfde, reassigning color and 
  search energy levels) on you linux computer. 
  For bound energy run:
      ./postmqdt-autoplot-ogpf.exe -dis -path YOUR_POST_PROCESS_DIR/
  for continuum energy run (NOTE: it is not correctly working right now):
      ./postmqdt-autoplot-ogpf.exe -au -path YOUR_POST_PROCESS_DIR/

  use can simply run 
      ./postmqdt-autoplot-ogpf.exe
  or ./postmqdt-autoplot-ogpf.exe --help
  or ./postmqdt-autoplot-ogpf.exe --h
  to have a look at the command line helper.

  If you also provide experimental energy levels in
     elev.exp
  We can compare the theory levels with them.

  Output files
     phystable.out        : all energy levels
     theo-exp-compare.out : compare theory with corresponding experiment levels
     generated gnuplot input file :
     exp-plot.out tau2-plot.out theo-plot.out [dfde2-plot.out (if you provide dalfa.in)]

4 plot JHANGZ with gnuplot on you linux computer:

  cd YOUR_POST_PROCESS_DIR/
  gnuplot plot6ch-draw.gnu

  !!! Note, I put NaN to prevent gnuplot to plot void data and break unnecessary connections.
  !!! But it seems so system or gnuplot version is not friendly with NaN.
  !!! Any way, the figures here are not so important, they are just for auxilary check purpose.
